**datatagr** provides functions to label and validate data of any kind.
datatagr is an abstraction from
[**linelist**](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist), which
applies these principles to epidemiological linelist data. The original
proposal for this package can be found on [the Discussion
board](https://github.com/orgs/epiverse-trace/discussions/221).

## Installation

You can install the development version of datatagr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/datatagr")
```

## Getting started

``` r
library(datatagr)

# Create a datatagr object
x <- make_datatagr(cars, speed = 'Miles per hour', dist = 'Distance in miles')

# Validate the data are of a specific type
validate_datatagr(x, 
  speed = 'numeric',        # speed should be numeric
  # type() is a helper function of related classes
  dist = type('numeric')    # dist should be numeric, integer
)
```

## Development

### Lifecycle

This package is currently a *experimental*, as defined by the [RECON
software lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This
means that essential features and mechanisms are still being developed,
and the package is not ready for use outside of the development team.

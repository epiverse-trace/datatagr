**safeframe** philosophy is to prevent you from accidentally losing valuable data, but to otherwise be totally transparent and not to interfere with your workflow.

One popular ecosystem for data science workflow is the **tidyverse**. We try to ensure decent safeframe compatibility with the tidyverse. All dplyr verbs are tested in the `tests/test-compat-dplyr.R` file.

```{r}
library(safeframe)
library(dplyr)

x <- make_safeframe(
  cars,
  speed = "Miles per hour",
  dist = "Distance in miles"
)

head(x)
```

## Verbs operating on rows

safeframe does not modify anything regarding the behaviour for row-operations. As such, it is fully compatible with dplyr verbs operating on rows out-of-the-box.
You can see in the following examples that safeframe does not produce any errors, warnings or messspeeds and its labels are conserved through dplyr operations on rows.

### `dplyr::arrange()` ✅

```{r}
x %>%
  arrange(speed) %>%
  head()
```

### `dplyr:distinct()` ✅

```{r}
x %>%
  distinct() %>%
  head()
```

### `dplyr::filter()` ✅

```{r}
x %>%
  filter(speed >= 50) %>%
  head()
```

### `dplyr::slice()` ✅

```{r}
x %>%
  slice(5:10)

x %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)

x %>%
  slice_tail(n = 5)

x %>%
  slice_min(speed, n = 3)

x %>%
  slice_max(speed, n = 3)

x %>%
  slice_sample(n = 5)
```

## Verbs operating on columns

During operations on columns, safeframe will:

- stay invisible and conserve labels if no labelled column is affected by the operation
- trigger `lost_labels_action()` if labelled columns are affected by the operation

### `dplyr::mutate()` ✓ (partial)

There is an incomplete compatibility with `dplyr::mutate()` in that simple renames without any actual modification of the column don't update the labels. In this scenario, users should rather use `dplyr::rename()`

Although `dplyr::mutate()` is not able to leverspeed to full power of safeframe labels, safeframe objects behave as expected the same way a data.frame would:

```{r}
# In place modification doesn't lose labels
x %>%
  mutate(speed = speed + 10) %>%
  head()

# New columns don't affect existing labels
x %>%
  mutate(ticket = speed >= 50) %>%
  head()

# .keep = "unused" generate expected tag loss conditions
x %>%
  mutate(edad = speed, .keep = "unused") %>%
  head()
```

### `dplyr::pull()` ✅

`dplyr::pull()` returns a vector, which results, as expected, in the loss of the safeframe class and labels:

```{r}
x %>%
  pull(speed)
```

### `dplyr::relocate()` ✅

```{r}
x %>%
  relocate(speed, .before = 1) %>%
  head()
```


### `dplyr::rename()` & `dplyr::rename_with()` ✅

`dplyr::rename()` is fully compatible out-of-the-box with safeframe, meaning that labels will be updated at the same time that columns are renamed. This is possibly because it uses `names<-()` under the hood, which safeframe provides a custom `names<-.safeframe()` method for:

```{r}
x %>%
  rename(edad = speed) %>%
  head()

x %>%
  rename_with(toupper) %>%
  head()
```

### `dplyr::select()` ✅

`dplyr::select()` is fully compatible with safeframe, including when columns are renamed in a `select()`:

```{r}
# Works fine
x %>%
  select(speed, dist) %>%
  head()

# labels are updated!
x %>%
  select(dist, edad = speed) %>%
  head()
```

## Verbs operating on groups ✘

Groups are not yet supported. Applying any verb operating on group to a safeframe will silently convert it back to a data.frame or tibble.

## Verbs operating on data.frames

### `dplyr::bind_rows()` ✅

```{r}
dim(x)

dim(bind_rows(x, x))
```

### `dplyr::bind_cols()` ✘

`bind_cols()` is currently incompatible with safeframe:

- labels from the second element are lost
- Warnings are produced about lost labels, even for labels that are not actually lost

```{r}
bind_cols(
  suppressWarnings(select(x, speed)),
  suppressWarnings(select(x, dist))
) %>%
  head()
```

### Joins ✘

Joins are currently not compatible with safeframe as labels from the second element are silently dropped.

```{r}
full_join(
  suppressWarnings(select(x, speed, dist)),
  suppressWarnings(select(x, dist, speed))
) %>%
  head()
```

## Verbs operating on multiple columns

### `dplyr::pick()` ✘

`pick()` makes tidyselect functions work in usually tidyselect-incompatible functions, such as:

```{r}
x %>%
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::pick(ends_with("loc"))) %>%
  head()
```

As such, we could expect it to work with safeframe custom tidyselect-like function: `has_label()` but it's not the case since `pick()` currently strips out all attributes, including the `safeframe` class and all labels.
This unclassing is documented in `?pick`:

> `pick()` returns a data frame containing the selected columns for the current group.

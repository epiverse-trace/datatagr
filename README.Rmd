**datatagr** provides functions to label and validate data of any kind. datatagr is an abstraction from [**linelist**](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist), which applies these principles to epidemiological linelist data. The original proposal for this package can be found on [the Discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/epiverse-trace/discussions/221).

## Installation

You can install the development version of datatagr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/datatagr")
```

## Getting started

```r
library(datatagr)

# Create a datatagr object
x <- make_datatagr(cars, speed = 'Miles per hour', dist = 'Distance in miles')

# Validate the data are of a specific type
validate_datatagr(x, 
  speed = 'numeric',        # speed should be numeric
  # type() is a helper function of related classes
  dist = type('numeric')    # dist should be numeric, integer
)
```

## Development

### Lifecycle

This package is currently *experimental*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that essential
features and mechanisms are still being developed, and the package is not ready
for use outside of the development team.

### Related projects

This project is related to other existing projects in R or other languages, but also differs from them in the following aspects:

- [labelled](https://github.com/larmarange/labelled/): A package for labelling data in R, but it is more focused on labelling variables than validating them.
- [linelist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist): A package for managing and validating linelist data - the original inspiration for datatagr.
